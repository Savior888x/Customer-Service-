Active Listening: Do’s and Don’ts
✅ Do’s of Active Listening

Pay full attention

Focus only on the speaker. Silence distractions (phone, background tasks).

Stay mentally present

Avoid drifting thoughts. Repeat key words silently to stay engaged.

Face the speaker

Position your body toward them to show attentiveness.

Maintain eye contact

Look at them naturally, not staring, to build trust.

Use open body language

Nod, lean slightly forward, and relax shoulders to signal interest.

Acknowledge verbally

Say short phrases like “I see,” “That makes sense,” or “Go on.”

Ask clarifying questions

Wait until they finish. Example: “Can you explain what you mean by…?”

Summarize or paraphrase

Restate their key points: “So what I hear you saying is…” to confirm understanding.

Extra Tips

Mirror tone (calm with calm, energetic with energetic).

Pause before answering to show you considered their words.

❌ Don’ts of Active Listening

Don’t fidget

Avoid tapping, clicking pens, or moving excessively. It signals impatience.

Don’t cross arms

Closed posture can appear defensive or uninterested.

Don’t shift weight constantly

It distracts and makes you look restless.

Don’t interrupt

Let them complete thoughts before responding.

Don’t pre-plan responses

Thinking of what to say next prevents true listening.

Don’t look away often

Breaking eye contact too much seems dismissive.

Don’t exaggerate gestures

Overly large hand movements can overwhelm or distract.

Extra Warnings

Avoid checking your watch or phone mid-conversation.

Don’t finish their sentences for them—it feels dismissive.

Don’t jump to judgment or advice until you fully understand.
