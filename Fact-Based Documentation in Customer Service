# 📝 Fact-Based Documentation in Customer Service

Documenting customer interactions is a core part of a customer service representative’s role.  
It helps track **what happened**, **why the customer called**, and **how you helped them**. Accurate documentation improves call center practices and enhances the customer experience.

## 🔑 What is Fact-Based Documentation?

Fact-based documentation focuses on the **facts of the interaction** rather than emotions, opinions, or verbatim conversation.  

- 🎯 Focus on the **customer’s problem** and **steps you took to resolve it**.  
- ⚠️ Do **not** include unnecessary details that don’t relate to the issue.  
- ⚠️ Do **not** describe your personal feelings or the customer’s emotional outbursts in detail.

## 💡 Tips for Fact-Based Documentation

- ✅ Keep it short, clear, and objective.  
- ✅ Record the **reason for the call**, actions taken, and **outcome**.  
- ✅ Note frustration or urgency only in terms of the problem, e.g., “Customer frustrated due to delayed shipment.”  
- ✅ Use clear, professional language.  
- ✅ Date and timestamp calls when possible.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- 🚫 Writing emotional or opinion-based notes.  
- 🚫 Transcribing the call word-for-word.  
- 🚫 Including unrelated dialogue or personal reactions.  
- 🚫 Skipping the resolution or next steps.  
- 🚫 Being vague about the problem or solution.
