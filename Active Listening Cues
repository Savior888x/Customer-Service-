# 🎧 Active Listening Cues

Active listening uses **verbal** and **non-verbal** cues to show customers you are paying attention.  
- **Verbal cues** = words or sounds that signal you are engaged.  
- **Non-verbal cues** = body language, facial expressions, and gestures.  

Both are essential in customer service, especially when trust and understanding matter.

## 🗣️ Verbal Cues
Verbal cues help show attentiveness, especially over the phone where body language is not visible.

### 🔑 Verbal Phrases
- “I see”  
- “Yes, I understand”  
- “That makes sense”  
- “Go on”  

### 🔊 Verbal Sounds
- “Mm-hmm”  
- “Uh-huh”  
- “Ah”  

These short sounds reassure customers that you are listening.

## 👀 Non-Verbal Cues
Non-verbal cues reinforce what you are communicating with words.

### 🧍 Body Language
- ✅ Face the speaker  
- ✅ Keep arms open and relaxed  
- ✅ Lean in slightly to show interest  
- ❌ Don’t cross arms  
- ❌ Don’t fidget or turn away  

### 🙂 Facial Expressions
- ✅ Smile naturally  
- ✅ Make steady (but not staring) eye contact  
- ❌ Avoid frowning or blank expressions  

### 🤝 Gestures

- ✅ Small thumbs-up when appropriate  
- ❌ Avoid exaggerated or distracting gestures

## 💡 Tips
- Mirror the customer’s tone (calm with calm, energetic with energetic).  
- Pause briefly before responding to show thoughtfulness.  
- Repeat or paraphrase to confirm understanding:  
  *“So what I hear you saying is…”*  
- Be consistent: words, tone, and body language should match.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes
- 🚫 Interrupting before the customer finishes.  
- 🚫 Pre-planning your reply instead of listening fully.  
- 🚫 Looking at your phone or watch.  
- 🚫 Finishing sentences for the customer.  
- 🚫 Overusing filler words (“yeah, yeah, right”) without sincerity.

## 📝 Summary
Active listening improves customer trust and satisfaction.  
- **Verbal cues** (words, sounds) = show you’re following along.  
- **Non-verbal cues** (body, face, gestures) = reinforce presence and empathy.  
Using both consistently creates stronger communication and a better customer experience.
