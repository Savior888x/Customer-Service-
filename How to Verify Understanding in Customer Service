# ✅ How to Verify Understanding in Customer Service

Verifying understanding ensures you **accurately capture the customer’s issue** and can provide the best solution.  
It is a key part of **active listening** and helps prevent miscommunication.

## 🔑 Two Main Ways to Verify Understanding

### 1. 🔄 Repeat
- Repeat exactly what the customer said to confirm accuracy.  
- Example: *“You said your order #4567 hasn’t arrived yet, correct?”*  
- Used in real-world scenarios like drive-thru orders to ensure nothing is missed.  

**Why it works:** Customers feel heard and you reduce errors in understanding.

### 2. ✍️ Paraphrase
- Use your own words to summarize the customer’s main points or ideas.  
- Ask the customer if your understanding is correct:  
  *“So you are saying that your package was delayed and you need it by Friday, is that right?”*  
- Clears up ambiguity and ensures alignment between you and the customer.  

**Why it works:** Provides clarity and allows the customer to correct any misinterpretation.
