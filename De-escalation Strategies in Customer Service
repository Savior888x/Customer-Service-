## 🔑 Core Strategies

### 1. 🪞 Mirror the Complaint
- ✅ Use active listening to gather details.  
- ✅ Repeat or paraphrase the customer’s issue back to them:  
  *“So, you’re frustrated because your order arrived late and damaged, correct?”*  
- ✅ Acknowledge feelings:  
  *“I understand how upsetting that must be.”*  

**Why it works**: Customers feel heard, validated, and reassured that you understand.

### 2. 📢 Narrate Your Problem-Solving Process
- ✅ Verbally explain the steps you’re taking:  
  *“Right now, I’m pulling up your order history… next I’ll check the shipping status.”*  
- ✅ Keep the customer informed instead of leaving silence or long holds.  
- ✅ Provide updates throughout the call.  

**Why it works**: Customers can’t see you. Narration builds confidence that progress is happening.

### 3. 🛠️ Provide Realistic Solutions
- ✅ Offer only solutions within company policy.  
- ✅ Present clear next steps and timelines.  
- ✅ Give options when possible:  
  *“I can refund the shipping fee or send a replacement—what would you prefer?”*  

**Why it works**: Avoids overpromising, keeps expectations realistic, and prevents repeat frustration.

## 💡 Tips

- Use the customer’s name to personalize the interaction.  
- Empathize before problem-solving: *“I can see why this situation would be frustrating.”*  
- Focus on solutions, not blame.  
- If needed, take responsibility as the representative: *“I’ll make sure this gets resolved for you.”*
